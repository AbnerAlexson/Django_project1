## Additional features
- authentication is implemented
- unauthenticated users are not able to create post or follow any users
- trying to create post will be redirected to the login screen
- the "Read more" in the feeds of post can be click and it will show the detail post
- shows dates of when the post is made

## things that need to be implemented for this to be a functional social media app
- user profile configuration i.e. edit name, profile image, edit/delete post
- detailView for following and followers
- view user profile and the post of the profile
- app settings
- and more

## additional tools
- Javascript is used to dymically change the website
  - (example: when a user creates a post the website will instantly show the post after it is created without being the page being refreshed)
- Tailwind css is used to style the website
